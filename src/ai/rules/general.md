# General

## Naming

- A name should say what a thing *is* or *does*, not how it's currently implemented or where it came from. Reject names that borrow jargon from one system to describe a concept in another (e.g. naming a general provider after a specific upstream dependency it happens to call today).
- If a name undersells fallible behavior (e.g. `query`, `get`, `fetch` for something that can raise or return an error), prefer a name that signals it, or route it through the project's established fallible-call convention.
- When picking between two reasonable names, prefer the one a new reader could guess the behavior of without opening the file.

## Splitting one branch into multiple PRs

When a plan splits a large diff into sequential PRs by file scope (e.g. "PR2 gets these whole files, PR3 gets the rest"), staging exactly the planned files is not enough validation. A type/name change in an early PR (e.g. renaming a class into a union member) can break files nominally scoped to a *later* PR — they still reference the old name, or access a now-narrower attribute without a match/isinstance guard — but this won't show up if the later PR's files sit unstaged in the same working tree, since the test runner and type checker read files off disk regardless of git staging.

Before committing an earlier PR in the split, isolate its exact tree:

```
git stash push --keep-index -u -m "later-PR leftovers"   # stash everything NOT staged
<test suite>                                              # full suite against staged-only tree
<type checker>                                             # diff error count against the base branch's baseline
git stash pop                                              # restore the rest of the split
```

If this surfaces a break in a "later PR" file, the fix (usually a rename or a narrowing `match`) belongs in the *earlier* PR, since that PR must leave the tree green standalone — don't defer it just because the plan said that file belongs later.
